*** =/.dotfiles/+hammerspoon/hs-hybrid=
This was my attempt to make modal vim and emacs key bindings work system-wide for macOS. I archived the [[https://github.com/armcburney/hs-hybrid][original repo]] because I wasn't happy with the product. The editing was janky at best. I have the original files here, because I like to play around with them, but they probably won't work as expected for your use case, and should be used with caution.

*** =/.dotfiles/+hammerspoon/hs-keys=
Custom key bindings for window management I use.

*** =/.dotfiles/+hammerspoon/hs-music=
Custom key bindings for iTunes and Spotify I use.
