*** =/hs-hybrid=
This was my attempt to make modal vim and emacs key bindings work system-wide for
macOS. I archived the [[https://github.com/armcburney/hs-hybrid][original repo]] because I wasn't happy with the product. The
editing was janky at best. I have the original files here, because I like to
play around with them, but they probably won't work as expected for your
use case, and should be used with caution.

*** =/hs-keys=
Custom key bindings for window management I use.

*** =/hs-music=
Custom key bindings for iTunes and Spotify I use.
