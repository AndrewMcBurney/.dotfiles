# dotfiles

My dotfiles, hammerspoon, emacs, and vim configurations.

## Install

## Hammerspoon config
I use [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) for Mac automation and system wide vim/emacs keybindings.

## Emacs config
I use [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) as my preferred text-editor because it allows me to use a hybrid style of vim and emacs keybindings, and has a rapidly growing community. You can view my `.spacemacs` config here in this repo.
